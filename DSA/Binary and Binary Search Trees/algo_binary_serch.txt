This is the simple algorithm that will make a binary tree from your preorder, postorder and inorder.

Algorithm:
1) Pick an element from preorder and create a node.
2) Increment preorder idx.
3) Search for picked element's position in inorder.
4) Call to build left subtree from inorder's 0s to position 1s.
5) Call to build right subtree from inorder pos+1 to n.
6) Return the node.
